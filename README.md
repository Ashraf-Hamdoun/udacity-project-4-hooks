## My Reads

# In this project you can find the all uses of the api and react


    - firstly i create a new app using `npx create-react-app my-reads`
    - then `cd my-reads` to get inside it
    - you can install it with ' npm i '
    - then I used <strong>Hooks<strong> in it

    # Advantages :
        - every book is in its shelf
        - you can move books between different shelves
        - if you choose "none" the book will be disappeared
        - in search page you can search easely
        - also you can move books between different shelves from search page
        - the app handles the errors and show no errors
        - if you add a book it appears in the list of books, in its specific shelf
        - i also handle the duplication of the books, so if you add the sane book
            you have , it wont be added to the list but you can remove it or choose its shelf 
        - I use some hooks to handle the project like  `useState` and `useEffect`
